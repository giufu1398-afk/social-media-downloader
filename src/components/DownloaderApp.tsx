                        direct tunnel the download button uses.

                        A media element requests bytes with a Range header, and
                        Cobalt tunnels answer that with a `206` that omits the
                        mandatory `Content-Range`. Browsers reject such a
                        response outright, so pointing <video> at the tunnel
                        produces a preview that always fails while the download
                        — a plain GET, no Range, clean `200` — works fine.
                        resolveRangeResponse() in lib/proxyHeaders.ts repairs
                        that shape, so going through the proxy is what makes
                        playback (and seeking) work at all.

                        The bandwidth argument still holds for downloads, which
                        is the high-volume path and still goes browser→tunnel
                        direct. A preview costs two extra clicks (Show preview,
                        then play) and preload='none' means nothing is fetched
